    <h1>Understanding the Interactions of Racial Capitalism</h1>
    <h3>I was prompted to map circuits of racial capitalism to understand how racial capitalism unites and divides people from all over the world. For this final project, I wanted to explore the ways Chinese people and environments were impacted by racial capitalism.</h3>

    <h2>The Treaty of Nanjing</h2>
    <div class="text-content">
      <p>After China's defeat in the Opium Wars in 1842, this treaty was one of the first of many "unequal treaties" that would be signed between China and the Britain or the United States. China was forced to make immense concessions in the name of so-called diplomacy.</p>
      <p>The concessions that China would make include the following changes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Opening five Chinese cities to British trade</li>
        <li>Paying war indemnities to the British empire</li>
        <li>Releasing of imprisoned British subjects</li>
        <li>Eliminating phrases Britain deemed derogatory</li>
        <li>Abolishing any system that restricted British merchant activity in China</li>

    <h2>The Treaty of Tianjing</h2>
    <div class="text-content">
      <p>The list of countries now making these unfair deals with China through gunboat diplomany only continues to grow. France, Russia, and the United States all make deals with China alongside Britian to further their own needs. The Chinese people become a medium by which those countries can further their own selfish objectives at the expense of Chinese citizens, resources, and labor. Against their will they are chained to these other countries.</p>

    <h3>So far we have seen the initial seeds of this racially capitalist circuit/connection that is rooted in China. It will be part of the influences on the subsequent questions where we can dive deeper into the relations particularly between China and American States.</h3>
    <h3>As we can see from the diagrams above, what connected these countries together was the treaties born of gunboat diplomacy. It it were not for these forced connections, there would have been little incentive to tie such vast and distant nations together so tightly.</h3>
    <h3>This connection between China and the other sections creates a clear distinction between the empires that take and gain and the country that must give and or risk losing what little it continues to have.</h3>
    <h3>And as a result, landscapes begin to reform. Some people are made to work and sacrifice their own labor and comfort for the desires of other nations. These western countries, the UK, France, the US, and Russia, all have reason to see themselves as above China, its people, and its needs.</h3>
    <h3>As a reaction to these many changes, it is plausible to say these treaties and the instability and decline they caused in China would have incentivized many to emigrate to other countries. If countries like the United States were perhaps excelling compared to China, then Chinese citizens could alter their fortunes by going there. </h3>

    <h2>Chinese Immigrants in California</h2>
    <div class="text-content">
      <p>During this same era of gunboat diplomacy, the number of Chinese immigratns in California jumped from 325 in 1849 to 63,000 by 1870. Within about twenty years, the Chinese immigrant population was multiplied by 190. Chinatowns would emerge in multiple Californian cities as a result, creating various pockets of Chinese culture and people within the state.</p>
      <p>These diasporic communities and their impact on Californian history continue to modern day. Such Chinatowns remain integral parts of major cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco and many others.</p>
      <p>Not all reactions to Chinese immigrants were positive. As mentioned, gunboat diplomacy gave the United States a sense of superiority over China. This sentiment extended to Chinese people as well. While Chinese immigrants were initially welcomed by Americans, resistance would follow in the form of exclusion acts and prohibitions of immigration. Many sexist and racist claims were made against Chinese people to justify the discrimintory nature of policies like Page Act of 1875 and the Chinese exclusion act of 1882.</p>
