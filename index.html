    <h1>Understanding the Interactions of Racial Capitalism</h1>
    <h3>I was prompted to map circuits of racial capitalism to understand how racial capitalism unites and divides people from all over the world. For this final project, I wanted to explore the ways Chinese people and environments were impacted by racial capitalism.</h3>

      <p>This map begins in the 1840s. In the coming years China's economic, political, and social spheres would all begin to be impacted by gunboat diplomacy.</p>

    <h2>The Treaty of Nanjing</h2>
    <div class="text-content">
      <p>After China's defeat in the Opium Wars in 1842, this treaty was one of the first of many "unequal treaties" that would be signed between China and the Britain or the United States. China was forced to make immense concessions in the name of so-called diplomacy.</p>
      <p>The concessions that China would make include the following changes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Opening five Chinese cities to British trade</li>
        <li>Paying war indemnities to the British empire</li>
        <li>Releasing of imprisoned British subjects</li>
        <li>Eliminating phrases Britain deemed derogatory</li>
        <li>Abolishing any system that restricted British merchant activity in China</li>

    <h2>The Treaty of Tianjing</h2>
    <div class="text-content">
      <p>The list of countries now making these unfair deals with China through gunboat diplomany only continues to grow. France, Russia, and the United States all make deals with China alongside Britian to further their own needs. The Chinese people become a medium by which those countries can further their own selfish objectives at the expense of Chinese citizens, resources, and labor. Against their will they are chained to these other countries.</p>

    <h3>So far we have seen the initial seeds of this racially capitalist circuit rooted in China. As we dive deeper into the connections between China and the United States this connection will be key to the subsequent questions we seek to ansewer.</h3> 
    <h3>As we can see from the diagrams above, what connected these countries together was the treaties born of gunboat diplomacy. If not for these forced connections, there would have been little incentive to tie such vast and distant nations together so tightly.</h3>
    <h3>We can see the distinction clearly between those that take and those that must give. Empires in power abuse their authority to demand another country fulfill their needs. The countries that serve as colonies are forced to comply or risk losing what little control they retain.</h3>
    <h3>As a result, landscapes begin to reform. Some people are made to work and sacrifice their own labor and comfort for the desires of other nations. The UK, France, the US, and Russia, all have reason to see themselves as above China, its people, and its needs.</h3>
    <h3>Emigration is a plausible reaction to the instability that followed in China. If a country like the United States could prosper at the expense of Chinese citizens and their labor then perhaps those very same people could alter those fortunes by emigrating.</h3>

    <h2>Chinese Immigrants in California</h2>
    <div class="text-content">
      <p>During this same era of gunboat diplomacy, the number of Chinese immigratns in California jumped from 325 in 1849 to 63,000 in 1870. Within roughly twenty years, the Chinese immigrant population was multiplied by 190. Chinatowns would emerge in multiple Californian cities as a result, creating various pockets of Chinese culture and people within the state.</p>
      <p>These diasporic communities and their impact on Californian history continue to modern day. Such Chinatowns remain integral parts of major cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco and many others.</p>
      <p>Despite the many contributions Chinese immigrants made to California economy and culture, not all reactions were positive. As mentioned, gunboat diplomacy gave the United States a sense of superiority over China. This sentiment extended to Chinese people as well. While Chinese immigrants were initially welcomed by Americans, resistance would follow in the form of exclusion acts and prohibitions of immigration. Many sexist and racist claims were made against Chinese people to justify the discriminatory nature of policies like the Page Act of 1875 and the Chinese exclusion act of 1882.</p>

    <h2>Chinese Immigrants in Hawaii</h2>
    <div class="text-content">
      <p>Given the trans-pacific trade importance that Hawaii held, it was a prime location for Chinese immigrants to find work and opportunity. Some of the first Chinese immigrants would arrive in 1852 to work on white-owned sugar plantations. These numbers would continue to grow in the coming years as they did in California.</p>
      <p>Hawaii also had an unfair treaty that tied them to the United States. The incoming Chinese immigrants began to prove a threat to their indigenous workers because some would even claim that Chinese workers were superior. If the native Hawaiian people were ever deemed "unruly" the American and  white business owners they worked for would even threaten to use Chinese immigrants as replacements for their labor.</p>
      <p>The "Yellow Peril" that developed would be used as ammunition by interested parties to convince the United States government to fully annex the Hawaiian kingdom as an American state in 1898.</p>

    <h2>Chinese Immigrant Identities</h2>
    <div class="text-content">
      <p>For this final section we examine the cultural shifts that Chinese immigrants faced as they acclimated themselves to living and working in foreign countries. Particularly, I want to emphasize how notions of Chinese identity changed.</p>
      <p>By this time period, the late 1890s, Chinese merchants had well established themselves and their fortunes in other countries, including Hawaii. However there still remained constant tensions between various racial and ethnic communities over their differences.</p>
      <p>What it meant to be "be Chinese" would be defined by two sets of key traits or characteristics. First there is feeling constantly "on the brink" of loss due to the parasitic nature of colonialism. Subseqently there is the character of being entrepreneurial, self-reliant, and maintaining autonomy of one's life and choices in a time that would pressure Chinese immigrants to be otherwise.</p>
